# In a Nutshell: Qanary Question Answering Components

The [Qanary Framework](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/) is dedicated to create Question Answering systems. Question Answering (QA) is a task requiring different fields leading to expensive / time consuming engineering tasks which might block research as it is too expensive. Typical problems/usecases that might occur while developing a question answering system are:

 * an algorithm is require analyzing textual questions and annotating the found entities, relations, classes, etc. 
    * it is time consuming as there are many services / algorithms / tools which need to compared 
 * your QA process needs to be improved
    * following traditional development approaches requires additional efforts for testing and debugging of code to uncover possible flaws
 * the quality of components dedicated to a particular task need to be analyzed
    * it is expensive to integrate all of the particular components due to a missing generalized interface

In this repository, the [components of the Qanary framework](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components)  are stored. All components are implemented in Java and provide a Docker container for lightweight maintaince.


## Build and run a *minimal* set of components

To show the Qanary methodology and it's functionality a tiny template-based Question Answering system was designed. It is capable of answering questions for a *real name* of a superhero like "What is the real name of Captain America?". For this purpose just two components were used:
 a) [Qanary DBpedia Spotlight component](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components/tree/master/qanary-component-NED-DBpediaSpotlight): The component is capable of finding superhero names and linking it to the [DBpedia knowledge base](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/) (such a process is called Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation).
 b) [Qanary Query Builder for Superhero Names](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components/tree/master/qanary-component-QB-SimpleRealNameOfSuperHero): The component is capable of creating [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) SELECT queries to be executed on DBpedia (such a component is typically called Query Builder) if the given question is following the template `What is the real name of <superheroname>`.

Hence, given a question following the described pattern the result will be SPARQL query that might be executed, s.t., the real name of a superhero is retrieved from DBpedia.


### Run a minimalistic Question Answering system

 1. [Install the Qanary core components](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary#how-to-run-the-code)
 2. Clone the current repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components.git
```
 3. Switch to the folder `Qanary-question-answering-components`:
```
cd Qanary-question-answering-components
```
 4. Build the minimal set of components using the Maven profile "tinytutorial" (here we skip creating the corresponding Docker images by adding the parameter `-Ddockerfile.skip=true` to the Maven command):
```
mvn clean package -Ddockerfile.skip=true -P tinytutorial
```
    * The output should look like the following indicating that the component `qa.NED-DBpedia-Spotlight``and `qanary_component-QB-SimpleRealNameOfSuperHero` was created:
```
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Reactor Summary:
[INFO] 
[INFO] qa.NED-DBpedia-Spotlight 2.1.0 ..................... SUCCESS [  3.717 s]
[INFO] qanary_component-QB-SimpleRealNameOfSuperHero 2.0.0  SUCCESS [  1.083 s]
[INFO] mvn.reactor 0.1.1-SNAPSHOT ......................... SUCCESS [  0.073 s]
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

 5. Now, both components might be started using the JAR files:
```
java -jar qanary_component-NED-DBpedia-Spotlight/target/qa.NED-DBpedia-Spotlight-X.Y.Z.jar
java -jar qanary_component-QB-SimpleRealNameOfSuperHero/target/qanary_component-QB-SimpleRealNameOfSuperHero-X.Y.Z.jar
```

 6. [Build and start a Qanary pipeline](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary#without-creating-docker-images)
 
 7. While having installed the Qanary components and Qanary pipeline using the standard configuration you can access a trivial Question Answering frontend via http://localhost:8080/startquestionansweringwithtextquestion
    * Use the question "What is the real name of Captain America?". 
    * The question can be answered using the given two components. 
    * Thereafter, the triplestore will hold a SPARQL query that was created by the QueryBuilder component `SimpleRealNameOfSuperHero` (for [DBpedia](http://DBpedia.org/SPARQL)). It could be used to retrieve the actual answer from DBpedia. The UI shows the graph ID where the computed information was stored.
      * Retrieve the SPARQL query from your Qanary triplestore using:
```
PREFIX oa: <http://www.w3.org/ns/openannotation/core/>
PREFIX qa: <http://www.wdaqua.eu/qa#> 

SELECT *
FROM <ADD-YOUR-GRAPH-ID-HERE>
WHERE {
    ?s a qa:AnnotationOfAnswerSPARQL.
    ?s oa:hasBody ?sparqlQueryOnDBpedia .
    ?s oa:annotatedBy ?annotatingService .
}
```



## Big Picture
 * Qanary is providing the methodology for a knowledge-driven, vocabular-based approach. Our long-term agenda is to create a knowledge-driven ecosystem for the field of Question Answering. It is part of the [WDAqua project](http://wdaqua.eu) where question answering systems are researched and developed.
 * [Qanary Framework](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/) is providing the core framework for creating Question Answering systems following the Qanary methodology. You might consider the Qanary Framework as reference implementation of the Qanary framework as microserivce-based component architecture.
 * [Qanary components](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-question-answering-components) is covering the QA components compatible with the Qanary framework.
 * [Frankenstein](https://github.com/WDAqua/Frankenstein) is a supporting framework to establish a toolset for rapid orchestration and benchmarking of Qanary components. For example, it provides the tools to create from 29 components 380 QA systems.


Regarding questions, ideas or any feedback related to Qanary please do not hesitate to [contact the core developers](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/wiki/Who-do-I-talk-to%3F). However, if you like to see a QA system originally built using the Qanary framework, one of our core developers has build a complete end-to-end QA system which allows to query several RDF data stores: [http://wdaqua.eu/qa](http://wdaqua.eu/qa).

Please go to the [GitHub Wiki page](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary/wiki) of Qanary repository to get more insights on how to use this framework, how to add new component etc.
